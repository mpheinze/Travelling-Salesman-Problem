# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
The Travelling Salesman Problem asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city?‚Äù  Originally adopted from a Star Craft II API application, this project attempts to solve the general computer scientific problem (stated above) using various Python libraries, including a K-Means algorithm.

The problem set includes 20 cites each comprised of a cluster of potentially overlapping coordinates.
